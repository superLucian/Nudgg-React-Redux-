The mix of equities and bonds in your portfolio is likely to be the biggest driver of your future returns – so, once you’ve thought about your goals, choosing the right balance is the next step.'

Vanguard\'s structure allows us to offer a high-quality investment service at low cost. And that low-cost advantage will compound over time, helping you to reach your goals faster.'

Investors who fall into this trap generate costs that they could easily avoid. What\'s more, they often end up damaging the performance of their portfolio. At Vanguard, we believe it\'s better to set an appropriate asset allocation to suit your goals, and then let time and the power of markets do the heavy lifting. You can even choose Vanguard funds that will automatically rebalance to the breakdown you\'ve chosen.'

We launched our PC Banking service in 1997, we were Text Message Banking in 1999, and Internet Banking in 2000. We were the first UK bank with a Twitter account. See that curve? We try to stay ahead of it... Because we know that our love for banking is quite unusual - you guys just want easy, seamless, intuitive control over your money, wherever, whenever.

          'Taavet Hinrikus and Kristo Käärmann are two friends who believe that money is meant to flow freely. But in the absence of a global currency, it doesn’t. An epiphany saved them thousands of pounds.<br>' +
          'Taavet had worked for Skype in Estonia, so was paid in euros, but lived in London. Kristo worked in London, but had a mortgage in euros back in Estonia. They devised a simple scheme. Each month the pair checked that day’s mid-market rate on Reuters to find a fair exchange rate. Kristo put pounds into Taavet’s UK bank account, and Taavet topped up his friend’s euro account with euros. Both got the currency they needed, and neither paid a cent in hidden bank charges.<br>' +
          '“There must be others like us," the epiphany went.<br>' +
