    title: `Investors fear European economy's hot run may have peaked`,
    type: 'investments',
    date: '2 days ago',
    author: 'The Telegraph',
    text: `Europe’s economy has been surging ahead this year but investors are increasingly cautious, fearing that the growth spurt may have peaked and that asset values could take a tumble.
Optimism among fund managers has fallen back from recent highs in Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s monthly survey of the sector, indicating that investors believe the recent rallies may have run their course.
Sentiment remains positive - those who expect corporate earnings to rise over the next 12 months outweigh those who expect a fall by a margin of 54pc.
That is down from 64pc a month ago, however, as some investors have cut back their forecasts of profit growth.

The proportion of very enthusiastic investors has also dived - in June a net 25pc anticipated double-digit percent growth in earnings. The number has fallen sharply to a net 11pc, “suggesting last month may have been the peak”, BAML said.
“To remain bullish about the eurozone, investors said they would need to see evidence of 10pc or more growth in earnings per share, and agreement on a structural reform agenda in major Eurozone countries,” the survey found.
Central bankers have tried hard to explain their plans clearly to avoid shocking markets with interest rate rises, but a substantial minority of fund managers - 31pc - see a mis-step by the European Central Bank or the US’s Federal Reserve as the biggest “tail risk” to markets right now.
That is the second biggest risk, only slightly behind a crash in the global bond market.
While risks in the bond market and other areas such as the Chinese debt market have been on investors’ radars for some time, fears of a central banking error have only emerged this month - no investors cited it as a potential hazard in June.
Meanwhile the UK remains a less attractive market for investors, and the indecisive general election in June has not helped improve confidence in British assets.
UK assets are being shorted more heavily than any other country or asset class in the survey, relative to historic levels of shorting identified by this survey, which has been carried out monthly since 2001.
By contrast banks and eurozone assets are unusually popular long positions, as investors are relatively keen on those by historical standards.
Cash is also unusually popular, indicating that investors retain a cautious outlook.

    type: 'investments',
    date: '2 days ago',
    author: 'The Guardian',
    text: `Shares in Asia have reached their highest point for nearly 10 years bolstered by a surge in stock markets around the world on the back of strong US corporate earnings.
As investors awaited the European Central Bank meeting for clues on its policy outlooks, the MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan added 0.15%, hovering near its highest level since December 2007.
In Japan, the Nikkei gained 0.1% to climb closer to a two year high. Australian stocks rose 0.3% and South Korea’s Kospi advanced 0.15%. Hong Kong was up 0.3% while the Shanghai Composite was up 0.2%.
The MSCI world index rose for its tenth straight session on Thursday and set a record high for the sixth consecutive day, lifted by all-time closing highs on Wall Street.
The FTSE100 in London was set to open up around 24 points, or 0.33%, according to futures trading.
“In the US, the earnings season seems to be surprising a little bit on the upside,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank in Cleveland.
“What we have seen recently in the economic reports suggests it should be even better overseas... So we have come to the point where things look pretty good in the U.S. and it looks even better in prospect overseas, so what’s not to like about equities,” he said.
The yen was marginally stronger at 111.83 to the dollar early on Thursday.

The Bank of Japan ended its two-day policy meeting on Thursday by keeping rates on hold but cut its inflation forecasts again.
The euro was up about 0.1% at $1.1528 early on Thursday, after scaling a 14-month high this week following seemingly hawkish comments by European Central Bank president Mario Draghi.
At Thursday’s meeting, the central bank may drop a reference to its readiness to increase the size or duration of its asset-purchase programme before announcing in the autumn how and when it will start winding down its bond buying.
“The euro has surged enormously on the back of hopes that the ECB is going to start the process of shutting the door on loose monetary policy,” Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at ThinkMarkets UK, wrote in a note.
“The ECB needs to be clear about its forward guidance and it should reinforce that in a subtle manner. Coming out of the gates too aggressively would create shock waves in the market.”
The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of trade-weighted peers, was steady at 94.762.
The Australian dollar revisited Wednesday’s two-year high early on Thursday, still heady from the minutes of the last Reserve Bank of Australia meeting, released on Tuesday, which showed the central bank had turned more upbeat on the economic outlook.
The Canadian dollar was flat on Thursday at C$1.2601 to the dollar. On Wednesday, it touched a 14-month high on record domestic factory sales and higher oil prices.
Oil prices, which hit a two-week peak on Wednesday on a bigger-than-expected weekly draw in crude and gasoline inventories in the US, were marginally lower early on Thursday.
U.S. crude fell less than 0.1% to $47.10 a barrel, after jumping 1.6% overnight. Gold rose about 0.1 percent to $1,241.06 an ounce on Thursday.

    title: `European Central Bank sticks to low rate monetary policy`,
    type: 'investments',
    date: '2 days ago',
    author: 'Independent',
    text: `The European Central Bank left its ultra-easy monetary policy stance unchanged as expected on Thursday, keeping rates at record lows and even leaving the door open to more asset buys if the outlook worsens.
After ECB chief Mario Draghi raised the prospect of policy tightening last month, he signalled that any policy tweaks would come only gradually, setting the scene for a possible discussion in September about a long-awaited tapering of its asset buys.
"We need to be persistent and patient because we aren't there yet, and prudent," Draghi told his regular news conference after a meeting of ECB policy-makers in Frankfurt.
He stressed that the bank's governing council were unanimous both on the decision to keep its guidance unchanged and to avoid setting a precise date for a discussion of future policy, noting only that it would occur in the autumn.
The prospect of reduced monetary stimulus has kept financial markets edgy, with investors sifting through clues to gauge how big central banks around the globe will unwind unconventional policy that have kept borrowing costs at rock bottom.
Euro and government bond yields across the bloc initially slipped after the statement. But as Draghi spoke, eurozone bond yields gained ostensibly on his confirmation of expectations that the taper would be discussed in autumn.
The euro firmed more than 3 per cent and German 10-year yields doubled since Draghi's policy hint. Indeed, the euro's 11 per cent rise this year will weigh on inflation, compounding the impact of a more than 10 per cent drop in crude oil prices.
"As core inflation remains subdued, the ECB will likely prefer to err on the side of caution, that is moving more slowly rather than faster than many observers project," Holger Schmieding at Berenberg noted.
Still, the ECB is unable to kick the can down the road indefinitely as its asset buys are set to run until the end of the year and policymakers argue that a decision on an extension or a gradual wind down must be taken in September or October.

    title: `Number of savings accounts peaks at 1,700 - so why aren't rates on the rise?`,
    type: 'savings',
    date: '2 days ago',
    author: 'The Telegraph',
    text: `There are now 1,700 savings accounts in Britain, a number which has risen by almost 300 in the last six months.
With that number of accounts you would expect competition for depositors' cash to be fierce. Why then are interest rates not on the rise?
The top rates may indeed have been creeping up recently, but rates on the whole are lower than in January last year.
According to Bank of England data, the average easy-access account paid 0.47pc in January 2016. Today the rate is 0.15pc.
Rates paid by the best accounts are also on the decline.
For example, the best easy access account in January 2016 paid 1.65pc from from RCI Bank. Now savers can earn just 1.25pc with Ulster Bank, the Irish provider.
The top one and two-year fixed-rate bonds offered 2.15pc from Union Bank of India, and 2.75pc, from Islamic provider, Al Rayan Bank (although this is an "estimated profit rate" in line with sharia principals, rather than a guaranteed rate of interest).
Al Rayan now offers the top one-year bond which pays a target rate of 2pc. Those who want a guaranteed rate of interest must settle for Paragon Bank's one-year fix which pays just 1.85pc.
In January 2016 long-term savers could also earn more than 3pc - a rate unheard of today in the savings market even with a seven year bond.
Secure Trust Bank's five-year bond offered 3.11pc and United Trust Bank's four-year account paid 3pc.
The highest rate available today is 2.55pc, from Bank of London and the Middle East, but savers would have to lock away funds for seven years and have a minimum deposit of £25,000. The rate is also not guaranteed as the bank follows Islamic rules.
Even this bond fails to beat inflation despite a surprise drop from 2.9pc to 2.6pc last month. The only accounts that do pay more are current accounts which offer up to 5pc although often come with restrictions.
In addition, there is little difference between the best deals and even those providers who are offering rate increases are doing so by as little as 0.01pc.
Charlotte Nelson, from Moneyfacts, said competition is unlikely to improve until the big banks get involved and start making improvements to their rates.
Ms Nelson said as the Bank of England has recently asked banks to hold more cash, in order to protect themselves against bad debts or a "potential crisis", the main providers may begin to offer better deals to encourage customers to deposit more of their money.
However, she suggested "as banks have some time to obtain the additional capital, it is unlikely that savers will see a dramatic increase in rates anytime soon."

    title: `'I saved and planned, but now I have to pay £15,000 extra stamp duty'`,
    type: 'savings',
    date: '2 days ago',
    author: 'The Telegraph',
    text: `Thousands of young people who bought buy-to-lets as a way of getting on to the property ladder are discovering they must pay tens of thousands of pounds in additional stamp duty when they come to buy a home for themselves.
Recent years have seen a growing trend for young professionals – especially those living in costly areas such as the South East – to buy first properties in cheaper areas. They let these out while continuing to rent closer to their work.
But changes to stamp duty introduced by former chancellor George Osborne, applying from 2016, mean that when they come to buy their main home they are liable to pay an additional 3pc stamp duty surcharge. Many only discover this once their purchase is well under way – and the higher bill comes as a shock.
There is a further irony, they say, in that older, better-off people who already owned two homes and who are “replacing” their main residence do not have to pay the extra duty. The policy favours those who already own multiple houses.
Sophie Fernandez, a 32-year-old teacher who lives in north London, bought her first property in Loughborough for £113,000 in August 2015 – months before the stamp duty changes were announced.
She is now ready to purchase her own home, but the prospect of paying an additional 3pc stamp duty means this will be difficult to afford.
A two-bed flat in Finsbury Park, where she is looking with a friend, will cost around £500,000. If this was her first purchase she would pay £15,000 in duty – but the “additional property” stamp duty rules mean her bill would be £30,000.
“I’m sure there are a lot of people in the same situation,” she said. “I am a teacher and lived abroad while saving up for a deposit, but when I got back everything was going over the asking price and I couldn’t afford to buy in London.” That was when she decided to buy elsewhere as a “first foot” on the ladder.
Miss Fernandez bought the property and spent £20,000 and a year renovating it. She suspects she would lose money if she sold it now – so she wants to hold on to it. She said: “It is just so unfair. I bought the property before I knew this was going to happen. If I had known, it wouldn’t have been worth it, and I wouldn’t have gone ahead.”
Nimesh Shah, a partner at Blick Rothenberg, the tax advisers, said Miss Fernandez will struggle to find any way of legitimately avoiding the extra charge. If she was “replacing” her main residence – selling her former residence within three years of the purchase – she would be able to apply for a refund of the additional 3pc charge. However, as she has no main residence to replace, this exemption does not apply.
While a veteran landlord with 50 buy-to-let properties and a main residence could thus avoid the additional charge, Miss Fernandez cannot.
Mr Shah said: “The policy intention was to stop people owning more than one property and that’s why Miss Fernandez is falling into it, but she went into buying the Loughborough property with no knowledge this would come in.
“Now she’s in a position to buy her home and she is being clobbered. The law is catching people out in situations such as this. She is unfortunately a victim.”
Mr Shah said there are two ways Miss Fernandez could avoid the surcharge. Firstly she could take the hit and sell the house in Loughborough before the purchase, meaning she would pay regular costs of stamp duty.
By doing this she would risk crystallising a loss if indeed the sale price is lower than the sums she has invested.
Her other option is more radical: she would have to leave London and move into the Loughborough property. If Miss Fernandez lived in the Loughborough property in the three years leading up to the new purchase, she could argue that she is “replacing” her main residence.
That way she would still pay the higher stamp duty on the new purchase. But, provided she sold the Loughborough house within three years, she would qualify for a refund for having lived there.
A house can be classified as a main residence if the person is registered to vote or registered for a doctors’ surgery at the address, alongside several other criteria.
From its inception the changes to stamp duty for “additional” properties have been beset with problems. Mr Osborne introduced the measure, along with other tax changes, as a way of trying to dampen enthusiasm for buy-to-let.
Under the new rules, anyone who buys an additional residential property, including holiday homes and buy-to-lets, has to pay an extra 3 percentage points in stamp duty.
All property transactions above £125,000 are subject to a stamp duty charge of at least 2pc, and the 3pc charge is on top of this. This means that purchases of between £125,000 and £250,000 are now subject to a 5pc charge, and then purchases up to £925,000 will incur an 8pc charge. Homes worth up to £1.5m are now subject to 13pc stamp duty and those over this amount will incur a 15pc charge.
This means, as in the example of Miss Fernandez, a purchase of a £500,000 home will now incur an additional £15,000 stamp duty payment.
“Accidental landlords” like Miss Fernandez or 26-year-old Claire Williams, from west London (left), have been caught out by this. Miss Williams never meant to become a landlord but got caught out when she bought a house without realising it had “tenants in situ”.
She went through with the transaction, only to discover when she bought her main home shortly afterwards that the higher rates would apply.
Couples who come together already owning one or two properties in their own names face other difficulties. If they marry, it is assumed under stamp duty rules that they are both owners of property, even if the technical ownership is in one person’s name.
This gives rise to financial incentives not to marry or even for married couples to divorce. Last year this newspaper reported the cases of numerous married couples who found themselves caught out by the system. Landlord Sajj Ahmed gave his buy-to-let property to his wife, which was a common practice ahead of the changes to tax relief that were recently introduced. However, as the property was mortgaged he was forced to pay stamp duty on the transaction, despite it occurring within a marriage. This ended up costing the couple thousands of pounds.
As Telegraph Money has reported, the complex rules have left conveyancers and property lawyers scratching their heads with new circumstances continually testing the system.
Correction: This article previously stated that the stamp duty due by Miss Fernandez would be £25,000 and £40,000. This has now been corrected.

    type: 'savings',
    date: '2 days ago',
    author: 'The Telegraph',
    text: `Cashback current accounts reward customers who make everyday transactions, such as paying household bills or making direct debit transactions.
They've proved popular with savers who benefit from extra earnings without the need to change their spending habits.However, the reward account market is shrinking as a number of providers have cut back on perks or increased fees.
For example, NatWest reduced the interest rate of its reward account from 3pc to 2pc in June, and Halifax cut its £5 monthly cashback to £3 in February.
A number of other providers, including Santander, TSB and Lloyds, all made cuts to their current accounts last year.
Nationwide is also expected to increase the fee of its FlexPlus account from £10 to £13 a month from September 21.
Rachel Springall, from Moneyfacts, suggested reward current account to be cut further - so customers should act quickly.
She said: "As banks are urged by the Bank of England to raise capital over the next few years for protection, it is entirely possible they will choose to constrict rewards for current account customers in order to retain more cash.
"Free banking is already a myth as most customers will pay for certain services through fees, and for those accounts that do offer a reward, it seems that time is running out to take advantage."
We've listed the top accounts that still offer rewards and cashback below.

Santander
Not technically a reward account, Santander’s 123 current account* offers a tiered cashback system.
It pays 1pc cashback on water and council tax bills. If you’ve got a mortgage with Santander, you’ll also get 1pc cashback on the first £1,000.
The account pays back 2pc on gas and electricity bills and 3pc on phone bills (mobile and landline), broadband and TV packages.
Customers also earn 1.5pc interest on balances up to £20,000.
There is a charge of £5 a month, but those who make the most of the cashback should cover this easily. Customers also need to pay in £500 each month and set up two direct debits.
How much could I earn in a year? £348
You could earn £240 in interest (£300 minus the fee) plus cashback. Santander suggests the average customer earns an extra £9 a month.
Santander's 123 Lite current account charges a smaller monthly fee of £1 but does not pay interest.
Customers can earn the same level of cashback as they do with the 123 account and between July 17 and September 30 the account offers an extra 5pc to customers who use Apple Pay, Android Pay and Samsung Pay.
The bank suggested that those who spend £30 a day for the 76 days of the offer would earn £114 in cashback. Customers who spend £10 a day for the same period would get £38.
The cashback will be paid into the account at the end of November.
Customers must still credit the account with £500 a month and set up two direct debits. They must also use online or mobile banking once every three months.
Halifax
Those who switch to Halifax's reward current account will earn £125 straight away if they use the Current Account Switch Service, a system set up to make switching easier.
The account also offers £3 cashback a month. Customers must pay in £750 a month and set up two direct debits.
An additional 15pc cashback can be earned on any money spent with selected partners such as Morrisons, Superdrug and Hilton.
How much can I earn in a year? £161
Those who also spend £100 a month with the selected retailers and get 15pc cashback each time, would earn £341.
The Halifax reward account is a decent deal but only for those who stay in credit - customers who dip into their overdraft could wipe out any reward due to the high daily usage fees.
TSB
The Classic Plus accountoffers £10 a month cashback.
Customers can earn £5 a month if they set up two direct debits and another £5 if they make 20 transactions on their debit card each month.
The account also pays 3pc on balances up to £1,500 if customers register for internet banking and paperless statements and correspondence. Customers must also credit the account with £500 a month.
How much could I earn in a year? £165 - £120 in cashback and another £45 interest.
Barclays
The Blue Rewards account from Barclays costs £3 a month, but pays up to £7 a month to customers who set up two direct debits. Customers must also pay in £800 each month.
You can earn an extra £5 a month if you have a Barclays mortgage. Another £1 a month is paid when customers take out or renew either buildings or contents cover and £3 a month if they go opt for both or Finer Home Insurance.
Barclays also pays an average of 4pc cashback if you shop online with its partners and 6pc cashback on Expedia bookings.
How much could I earn in a year? £48
Customers who spend £100 a month with Barclays' selected partners would earn another £4 a month, based on the average 4pc cashback. This is an extra £48 a year - £96 in total.
Those with a Barclays mortgage would earn another £60 in a year.
NatWest
NatWest has recently cut its reward account so it pays just 2pc back on seven household bills paid by direct debit including council tax, water, gas and broadband. It used to offer 3pc.
The bank also offers 1pc cashback to customers who make purchases at selected retailers such as The Bodyshop, P&O Ferries and Jamie's Italian.
The account costs £2 a month.
How much could I earn in a year? It depends on your household spend.
Monthly outgoings of £100 would earn nothing once the fee is paid.
Customers with bills of £500 a month would get £96.
NatWest said the average customer earns £83 a year based on their spend - £59 once they have paid the fee.
Co-Op Bank
Co-Op Bank current account customers who opt for its "Everyday Rewards" scheme could earn £5.50 a month.
Those who credit the account with £800 a month, set up four direct debits, opt for paperless statements and log in to their online or mobile banking account once a month will qualify for the monthly £4 reward.
Customers can also earn 5p each time they spend on their debit card, up to £1.50 a month.
How much could I earn in a year: £66
