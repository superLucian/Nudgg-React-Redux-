      Overdrafts and current accounts
    </Heading>
    <Paragraph>
      An agreed overdraft is a way of borrowing money from the bank through your current account, allowing you to spend more than you have in your account. Banks usually charge you interest or a fixed amount for lending this money. The interest is often at a higher rate than a personal loan. However, some offer interest-free overdrafts.
